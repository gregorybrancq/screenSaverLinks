# screenSaverLinks

This program allows to select images you want to see in screensaver by 
creating symbolic links. No need to create a special directory for them, 
or to copy them.

Based on exif tags, you can select images and disable another ones.

A directory will contain the links with all your selected images.\
Then you can tell to your favorite screensaver tool to go inside this directory 
and display them for your own pleasure.
